\begin{eqnarray}
dx &=& \tilde{r}x \left( 1- \frac{x}{\tilde{f}} \right) \, dt + \alpha x \, dW \label{eq:dx} \\
dm &=& (\rho m - \beta x + P )dt - \beta x \, dW, \label{eq:dm}

We discuss the model employed to describe the population of deer and
the associated bond fund used to balance the liabilities associated
with claims that result from deer and automobile collisions. -- give
an overview and outline for this section --

By employing the use of stochastic differential equations, the system can be used to explain how an insurance company can respond to the random fluctuations of the population of deer that affect how they can price their premiums. 

Overview of the issues and motivation.


 
By employing the use of stochastic differential equations, a system of equations can be constructed to describe the population of deer and the associated bond fund used to balance the liabilities of claims that result from deer-vehicle collisions.
